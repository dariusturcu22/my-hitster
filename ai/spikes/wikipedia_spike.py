"""Spike: English Wikipedia full-text search + lead-section extract, see
spikes/README.md.

Unlike Wikidata's wbsearchentities (literal label matching, title-only),
Wikipedia's list=search is real full-text search and handles a combined
"title artist song" query directly, so the artist is sent as part of the
query itself, not just used to disambiguate afterward.

Wikipedia has no structured release-year field the way Wikidata's P577
claim is: this returns the lead section as plain prose, an LLM extraction
pass is what turns that into a year (see combo_prompts.py), not anything
in this module.

Same Wikimedia infrastructure as Wikidata (confirmed: same rate-limit
policy, same User-Agent policy, mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_APIs/Rate_limits
states limits apply "across all sites and platforms"), but a bot password
is issued per-wiki, the existing Wikidata one won't authenticate here;
falls back to the same 10/minute anonymous tier if
WIKIPEDIA_BOT_USERNAME/PASSWORD aren't set in ai/.env.

Usage: python spikes/wikipedia_spike.py "<title>" "<artist>"

    its own same-titled album ("Hot (Inna song)" vs. "Hot (Inna album)"),
    unlike Wikidata or MusicBrainz, which both needed real disambiguation
    logic against ambiguous or absent type metadata. But that preference
    only matters among results that are actually about this title in the
    first place: filters to results whose own title contains the query
    title before applying any type preference, otherwise an unrelated
    same-artist song ranking in the top few results (for example
    "Together Forever (Rick Astley song)" showing up for a "Never Gonna
    Give You Up" search) gets picked just for having "song" in its title,
    confirmed as a real failure mode live-testing this against the
    49-song set, not a hypothetical.

    query_type flips which parenthetical is preferred: "track" (the
    default) prefers "song"/"single"; "album" prefers "album"/"ep"
    instead, and specifically avoids "song"/"single" results, needed once
    album lookups started reusing this same function (see
    run_full_wikipedia.py), an unrelated same-titled film ("A Night at
    the Opera (film)", not the Queen album) was picked before this
    existed, since the old track-only preference had no reason to avoid
    it either.

    When no result's title even contains the query title (a real case:
    some niche tracks, like a vaporwave cult release found in this
    project's own test set, have no dedicated article, only their parent
    album's, and some albums, like a Filipino rock album also in this
    project's test set, have no dedicated article at all), the type
    preference isn't applied at all, that risks the exact same
    wrong-result failure the title-matching filter exists to prevent.
