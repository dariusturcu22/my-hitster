"""Third batch for calibrating the fast-tier MusicBrainz/Discogs traffic
split. Romanian pop, manele, and other regional/niche songs, per direct
user request rather than the mostly Western/mainstream mix the first two
batches leaned on. Ground truth researched here via web search against
each song's own Wikipedia article or, where Wikipedia had nothing,
multiple independent platform listings (Spotify/Discogs/JioSaavn) agreeing
on the same date; not guessed. Two entries (Hot, Mr. Saxobeat) are
deliberately the single's release year, not its later album's, since
that single-vs-album gap is exactly the kind of mislabeling the user
flagged happening on mainstream platforms for this artist. Wikidata is
deliberately excluded, same reasoning as the second batch. See
spikes/README.md.

Manele coverage on Wikipedia turned out thin: most artists' pages list
only a hit-song rundown with no dated per-song discography, several
otherwise-strong-looking song titles couldn't be pinned to a reliable
date and were left out rather than guessed at. That thinness is itself
a real data point for how MusicBrainz/Discogs are likely to perform on
this category, worth noting when reading the results, not just a
research inconvenience.
