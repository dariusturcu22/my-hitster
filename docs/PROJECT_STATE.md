# PROJECT_STATE.md: Stories and Status

This file is the backlog. Every planned or completed piece of functionality is a story with a stable ID. IDs reflect the order stories were written down, not priority; the order to work on stories is decided separately.

`TASKS.md` is what work actually happens from. This file is context, read it to understand the bigger picture behind a task, not as a list of things to do.

## Status legend

- Implemented: built and working.
- Ready: has confirmed tasks in TASKS.md, checked against the real code, can be worked on.
- In Progress: actively being worked on.
- Needs Definition: confirmed as wanted, tasks may exist as a draft, but not yet checked against the real code.
- Dropped: considered and explicitly rejected, distinct from Needs Definition, which just means not yet gotten to.
- Consolidated: merged into another story's tasks rather than kept as its own, see the story it points to.

A story can have draft tasks written against it in TASKS.md while still marked Needs Definition. That alone doesn't unlock work. A story only becomes Ready once those tasks are confirmed accurate against the real codebase.

## Stories

| ID | Story | Area | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7 | Hosting migration off Fly.io, target platform undecided | Infra | Needs Definition |
| 8 | Database migration off Supabase, whether to migrate at all and to what platform both undecided | Infra | Needs Definition |
| 9 | DJ opens the real YouTube page or app instead of an embedded player | Game / Compliance | Needs Definition, draft tasks exist, confirmed blocked on stories 10, 11, and 39 |
| 10 | Game session: round-by-round gameplay within a group, rounds, guesses, betting, scoring, win condition; ephemeral, purged when the session ends except for a downloadable results export | Game | Ready |
| 11 | Real-time game sync over WebSocket | Realtime | Ready |
| 12 | Voice chat between players in a group, mesh peer-to-peer with Cloudflare TURN fallback, joinable and leavable anytime for the group's lifetime | Realtime | Needs Definition, draft tasks exist, confirmed blocked on stories 11 and 39 |
| 13 | Group-scoped text chat, active from group creation until the group is deleted | Realtime | Needs Definition, draft tasks exist, confirmed blocked on stories 11 and 39 |
| 14 | Song search by link or by keyword before submission | Frontend / Backend | Ready |
| 15 | Song/playlist relational fix, so one song can belong to multiple playlists | Backend | Ready |
| 16 | pgvector-based duplicate detection before running the metadata pipeline | Backend / AI | Ready |
| 17 | Community song reports: report button, message, correct year, sources | Frontend / Backend | Ready, admin review surface additionally needs story 19's admin role, not yet built |
| 18 | Criteria for promoting a reported or newly submitted song to verified | Backend | Needs Definition, criteria decided (`DECISIONS.md`) and draft tasks exist, blocked on story 23's `verificationStatus` field, which doesn't exist yet |
| 19 | Admin bulk song import | Backend | Consolidated into story 40 |
| 20 | Local LLM option for lower-cost bulk metadata processing | AI | Needs Definition, model/technique choice needs a separate exploration pass first |
| 21 | Auto-generated featured playlists: consolidated into story 30, see there for its card-assembly tasks | Backend / AI | Consolidated into story 30 |
| 22 | Test coverage for existing and new functionality | Quality | Ready |
| 23 | Song schema reconciliation against the current implementation | Backend | Ready |
| 24 | Parallelize metadata pipeline fetches across sources | Backend / AI | Needs Definition, draft tasks exist, confirmed blocked, parallelizing today's mostly-stubbed source set is wasted work until story 25 (Discogs) ships and MusicBrainz/Wikidata (untasked, see open questions) are actually built |
| 25 | Add Discogs as a metadata source | Backend / AI | Ready |
| 26 | Cache metadata pipeline results by artist/title or YouTube ID | Backend / AI | Ready |
| 27 | Rate limiting | Backend | Ready |
| 28 | UI redesign | Frontend | Needs Definition |
| 29 | Content-based song recommender: audio-feature metadata (tempo, energy, valence), cosine similarity, works with zero user data | Backend / AI | Dropped, no viable audio-feature data source found (researched, see `TASKS.md`) |
| 30 | Difficulty-tuned game session generation: on-the-spot card sets scored to a group's actual players, easy/medium/hard, absorbs story 21's card-assembly mechanics | Backend / AI / Frontend | Needs Definition, draft tasks exist, confirmed blocked on story 10, no `Guess` entity exists yet for either the aggregate score or the personalized layer; medium-difficulty's scoring formula is also undecided |
| 31 | "Similar songs" feature using pgvector embeddings over song title and artist | Backend / AI | Dropped, only the audio-based version was worth building, see story 29 |
| 32 | LLM-as-judge catalog audit: periodic pass over the existing catalog flagging likely duplicate or mislabeled songs | Backend / AI | Ready, review surface additionally needs story 19's admin role, not yet built |
| 33 | Analytics data store: separate append-heavy store for usage/event data (games played, session length), apart from the transactional Postgres database | Infra | Ready |
| 34 | First-party usage analytics: track games played and session length through a self-hosted or custom event pipeline, no third-party trackers | Backend / Frontend | Needs Definition, draft tasks exist, confirmed blocked on story 33 and, for the abuse-visibility events, on stories 10, 13, 17, and 27 actually shipping too |
| 35 | Public ground-truth data API: verified `(artist, title, release_year)` triples only, no YouTube links or unverified entries | Backend | Ready, the verified-only filter additionally needs story 23's `verificationStatus` field, not yet built |
| 36 | Open-source collaboration readiness: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, issue/PR templates | Docs / Community | Ready |
| 37 | Privacy policy, terms of service, and GDPR compliance | Legal / Compliance | Ready |
| 38 | Observability: error tracking and monitoring | Infra / Quality | Ready |
| 39 | Group: persistent lobby a game session lives inside, invite-link membership, admin role, live-synced settings, chat and voice from creation, timer-based lifecycle | Game | Ready |
| 40 | Catalog seeding queue (admin, patient, backlog-based) and user-facing bulk import (any user, immediate), absorbs story 19 | Backend / AI | Needs Definition, draft tasks exist, blocked on story 20 (LLM tier choice), story 23 (schema), and the metadata-sourcing spike's real implementation landing |
| 41 | Submission content safety: reject non-music and compilation submissions, defend LLM-facing steps against prompt injection in untrusted YouTube text | Backend / AI | Needs Definition, draft tasks exist, applies to every submission path, not just story 40, blocked on the same metadata-sourcing spike implementation |

## Open questions

- Flutter app: keep, repurpose, or drop? Must follow the same real-link-out rule as the rest of the product in the meantime, no exceptions.
- Future idea, not yet a story: once story 34's abuse-visibility events (rate-limit-exceeded, report-submitted, and now story 41's flagged-injection-attempt) accumulate real data, a user-moderation feature (warnings, bans) based on a pattern of that behavior over time. Deliberately not scoped now, noted so it isn't lost.
- Metadata source API usage: resolved. Source set is MusicBrainz, Discogs, and Wikidata; Genius, Last.fm, and live Wikipedia search were reviewed and dropped rather than fixed (see `docs/DECISIONS.md`).
- Story 30's personalized difficulty layer needs real interaction data to beat its own aggregate baseline; the aggregate baseline itself works as soon as story 10 ships and rounds start accumulating `Guess` rows, without needing months of data the way the collaborative-filtering enhancement does, but neither exists until story 10's `Guess` entity does. Likely won't clearly beat the baseline at the 100-200 user target scale until real usage accumulates over months of casual play.
- Story 30: medium-difficulty group scoring formula is undecided. `DECISIONS.md`'s story 30 entry settles easy (the group's lowest individual predicted score) and hard (a plain average), but never states medium's, don't assume it matches hard's.
- Story 32 (LLM catalog audit) and story 18 (verification criteria) are related but distinct: 18 is the per-submission path to verified, 32 is a periodic pass over the whole existing catalog. Whether 32 feeds into 18's criteria or stays a separate audit tool isn't decided.
- Story 35's data (artist/title/release_year triples, sourced from MusicBrainz/Discogs/Wikidata, all CC0) doesn't include anything sourced from the YouTube API, so it doesn't carry the redistribution risk a YouTube-link-inclusive version would have. Worth a final confirmation read of YouTube's terms before shipping regardless, since the catalog's provenance mixes sources.
- Story 23: whether release year should be `submittedYear` (immutable) plus `verifiedYear` (null until verified), or one mutable field plus `verificationStatus`. The two-field version preserves the original submission after a correction; the one-field version is simpler. Undecided.
- Story 23: how multiple artists (a main artist plus one or more featured artists) are stored and guessed. Today's `Song.artist` is a single string. Undecided whether storage should be an array, whether featured artists must be guessed correctly too, and what the guess-box UI looks like for more than one artist. Affects story 10's artist/title guess box and the AI microservice's extraction logic too, not just this story's schema.
- How much typo tolerance an in-round artist/title guess gets before counting as correct (see `GAME_DESIGN.md`'s Earning tokens section) is undecided, needs testing to balance against false positives. Distinct from story 18's song-verification criteria, this is about matching a player's guess text during a round, not about trusting a submitted song's metadata.
- Deployment target (story 7) and database target (story 8) are both undecided pending more research, deliberately deferred until the app is close to feature-complete locally. Leaving Fly.io is confirmed; Azure Container Apps as the replacement is not. Migrating off Supabase at all is undecided, let alone a target; Azure Database for PostgreSQL and Neon have both come up but neither is chosen.
- Story 30: should a song's country of origin or language keep it out of certain difficulty tiers for players unfamiliar with that country's music (a Romanian-language song known only domestically versus one, like "Dragostea Din Tei," that's an international hit despite being Romanian)? Undecided whether this becomes its own filter dimension alongside difficulty, or how it interacts with story 30's tiers at all. Ties into story 23: whether to persist structured fields for this beyond `metadataRaw`'s raw dump, MusicBrainz's artist `area` field and Wikidata's `P407` (language of work) and sitelinks count (language-edition Wikipedia articles, a rough international-reach proxy) all tested reliably during the metadata-sourcing spike; Wikidata's `P495` (country of origin) was not reliably populated at the song level. Neither the schema fields nor the game-design filter itself are decided, this is tracked as a real open question, not assumed.

## Resolved questions

- Where is the current Postgres instance hosted? Supabase, confirmed.
- Compliance and production-readiness: privacy policy, terms of service, GDPR compliance, and observability were a stated goal in `docs/VISION.md` with no story attached. Now stories 37 and 38.
- Story 10's session-state persistence and win-condition scaling were open questions. Both resolved: ephemeral Postgres rows, and an admin-configured card count bounded by player count. The group/game-session split that resolved them is documented in `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `GAME_DESIGN.md`, and logged in `DECISIONS.md`. Now story 39.
